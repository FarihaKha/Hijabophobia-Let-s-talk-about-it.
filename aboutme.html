      <h3>Hello! <em>As-salamu alaykum</em>! My name is Fariha Kha.</h3>
      <img id="fariha" src="assets/SalmonFariha.png" alt="Picture of Fariha Kha">
      <p>My hijab journey started when I was very young. One day, when I was six years old, I decided to wear a hijab because I thought that hijabs were beautiful. My parents supported me, so I went to school wearing a cute little blue headscarf the next day. The moment I walked into my school, all of the students and teachers looked at me differently. At the time, I did not know what Islamophobia was. I did not realize what was happening and I did not know that it was only going to get worse. Everyday, my classmates would laugh at me and think that I was bald. My teacher would ask me to take my hijab off all the time, but I would never respond. I would just cry. I noticed that my teacher started to treat me differently, but I never talked back to her. I was always afraid. I didn't even know why she wanted me to take it off. After one year, I stopped wearing a hijab and had never worn a hijab in public again for about ten years. For a long time, I was ashamed of my religion, but now, I'm not ashamed anymore. I think what happened actually helped me become stronger and more confident.</p>
      <p>I do not want anyone to experience what I had to go through or have to experience worse. I created this website so that I can educate others on this issue in hopes that nothing like this would ever happen again.</p>
