      <h3>Do you have questions about the hijab but do not feel comfortable asking them? Look no further! Below you will find the answers to the most common questions about the hijab answered by me, your favorite hijabi :)</h3>
      <h4>Do you shower/sleep with that on? Also, aren't you hot in that?</h4>
      <p>Ah. The questions that hijabis dread the most. No, we do not have to wear a hijab at all times. As for the second question, yes, I am "hot in that" sometimes. I understand that people who ask these questions are showing that they care, but I highly recommend that people stop asking them because hijabis have heard them enough.</p>
      <h4>Are you forced to wear the hijab? Doesn't that show that you are being oppressed?</h4>
      <p>No, I am not forced to wear the hijab. In Islam, it is actually wrong to force someone to wear it. Wearing a hijab is a choice that the person should make. Additionally, no one is allowed to force someone to wear it a certain way. If someone is being forced to wear a hijab, that is indeed oppression. This also goes hand in hand with someone telling a hijabi to take off the hijab. Forcing someone to take it off is oppression as well.</p>
      <h4>But I have Muslim friends who don't cover their hair. Is that wrong?</h4>
      <p>Once again, the hijab is a personal decision and remember that a hijab does not always mean a headscarf. Wearing a hijab is a choice of modesty.</p>
      <h4>Isn't it very sexist that women have to wear the hijab, but men don't?</h4>
      <p>That's actually incorrect. Men have a hijab as well. Modesty is for everyone, not just women. Men are supposed to cover up as well and lower their gaze.</p>
      <h4>What if it's too hot? Can you take the hijab off if it is too hot?</h4>
      <p>Yes! Health and safety always comes first in Islam! Also, if someone's life is in danger and is being forced to take off the hijab for Islamophobic reasons, then it is fine if the person takes it off.</p>
      <h4>Is it cultural appropriation if I want to wear a hijab even though I am not a Muslim?</h4>
      <p>No, this is not culutral appropriation. Remember, a hijab is part of the religion Islam, not a culture. Instead of offending Muslims, you will actually uplift us! As long as you have good intentions, you can rock a headscarf however you want!</p>
      <h4>Is it rude to compliment people for their hijab?</h4>
      <p>Not at all! I love compliments in general, but when someone compliments my hijab, I feel even more special and confident.</p>
